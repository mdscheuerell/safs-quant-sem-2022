Ecologists have long been intrigued by the interactions within and among various species, and how those interactions contribute to the overall stability of communities. Historically, much of our inference has been based upon experimental studies that manipulate the number and composition of organisms, but they are often limited in size and scope. More recently, however, advances in statistical methods have allowed us to identify top-down, bottom-up, and competitive interactions from observational data collected over time.
