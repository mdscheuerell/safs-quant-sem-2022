Ecologists have long been intrigued by the interactions within and among various species, and how those interactions contribute to the overall stability of communities. Historically, much of our inference has been based upon experimental studies that manipulate the number and composition of organisms, but they are often limited in size and their scope for inference. More recently, advances in statistical methods have allowed us to infer the strength of top-down, bottom-up, and competitive interactions from observational data collected over time. Specifically, modeling density-dependent population dynamics as a discrete Gompertz process for each individual species or taxonomic group allows us to estimate the per capita effects of intra- and interspecific competition, predation, and mutualism, as well as the effects of environmental covariates. We can then use these estimates to compute a variety of metrics to characterize the stability of the larger community. I will provide an overview of the modeling framework, and review the background and rationale for stability concepts like return time, reactivity, and the proportion of overall community variance owing to species interactions. I will then demonstrate how one goes about estimating community interactions and stability using a unique, long-term data set on plankton in Lake Washington.
